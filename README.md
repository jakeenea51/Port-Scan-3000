***Port-Scan 3000*** takes in the IP address of a target device and scans for and displays any open ports. This is done by using the _socket_ python library. This program is meant to demonstrate how to create your own custom port scanner that can be used in a practical environment.

*Disclaimer*: Do not scan anyone's device without their permission.
